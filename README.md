# Covid19_IndiaEDA
This is an EDA of Covid 19 and vaccination situation of India. I tried to show the crucial states of confirmed cases and vaccination situations here.

A detailed analysis on Covid-19 in India by Python.

In this project i have analized Covid-19 patients, deaths, recovered and vaccinations throghout the year and presented my related findings using python(numpy, pandas, seaborn).

This project uses a xlsx file which contains all the information we want about the situation and then used other libraries such as Pandas, matplotlib , seaborn and emoji to wrangle the data.

To go through every step, go and check the jupyter notebook file attached.
